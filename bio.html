    <p>Hi, my name is Karan. I am the co-founder of <a href="https://tensorparc.com">TensorParc</a>.</p>
    <br><br>
    <div>
      <p>In 1990, I got my first PC and began coding. In 1998, I started one of the first online stores in Germany, Geschenk24.com, which was acquired by Metro in 2001.</p>

      <p>In 2015, I founded CodeDoor, a platform empowering people to learn and teach coding.</p> 

      <p>Since 2019, I have been on a mission to bring space-based studies to German classrooms. We help grades 6 to 12 conduct earth-based experiments that are also performed on the ISS.</p>

      <p>Since 2022, my team and I have been running the Creators Program—coding camps that help students build anything they want.</p>

      <p>Sometimes, when venture capitalists need insight into startups and their founders, they call me for advice.</p>

      <p>My curiosity has led me to hold lectures about my findings at the University of Giessen and the Handelshochschule in Leipzig. I’ve advised many large corporations as well.</p>

      <p>I strongly believe that solutions to many of today’s challenges can be found outside the current societal mainstream. The writings of Bahá'u'lláh, for example, I find particularly thought-provoking.</p>

      <p>I play around with science topics in general. If you want to talk about or play basketball, send me an email.</p>

      <br>
      <p>You can reach me by email at my initials at tensorparc.com.</p>
