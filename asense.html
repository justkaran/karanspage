<h1>Has the World Gone Mad?</h1><br>
<p class="pt-3">July 2021</p>

<p>Until recently, I didn't give much thought to the idea that the world might be going mad. I always figured unpredictability was just part of life. But 2020 changed that. Suddenly, nothing seemed predictable anymore. Social issues became moving targets, and the old, static solutions no longer worked. It got me thinking: is the world actually getting crazier?</p>

<p>You don't need a detailed analysis to feel that something's off. Unprecedented events naturally seem crazy because we've never seen them before. And lately, unpredictable events are popping up everywhere. So yes, in a sense, the world is getting crazier.</p>

<p>But why is this happening, especially now when technology has advanced so much? It struck me that the world today resembles a teenager in the midst of an identity crisis. We have irrational behaviors intersecting with unprecedented capabilities. The result is a series of events that no one can predict.</p>

<p>Consider how tiny events suddenly have massive, global impacts. It's a combination of globalization and nonlinear dynamics. The classic example is the butterfly effect—the idea that a small change in one place can lead to significant consequences elsewhere. A virus jumps from a bat to a human, and before we know it, the entire world shuts down.</p>

<p> If we don't address these chaotic developments, we risk undermining the stability of our civilization. People need to trust that society can handle threats. When that trust erodes, we're in trouble.</p>

  <p>One of the greatest threats to civilization is the belief that our governments are losing control, may it be fueled by fears of poverty, crime, illness or war. Another driving factor is despair—a sense of meaninglessness. When people lose hope, they become vulnerable to demagogues who offer simplistic solutions. That's a dangerous path.</p>

<p>The key to fighting despair is action. People need to understand the events and processes that affect their well-being. No one can be alert to everything, but each of us can focus on our own areas of competence. By taking action in our fields, we contribute to a collective resilience.</p>

<p>But there's a catch: many people wait until they feel ready to act. They expect motivation to come first. In reality, action often precedes motivation. Start doing something—even if you don't feel like it—and the energy and motivation will follow. It's like building a startup. The initial version is simple, but it evolves quickly as you keep working on it.</p>

<p>In a world that seems increasingly unpredictable, perhaps our best response is to focus on what we can control: our own actions. By staying engaged and persistent in our efforts, we can navigate the madness and maybe even reduce it.</p>
